                            <h2>Quarterback</h2>
                            <p>
                                In modern football, the quarterback is the leader of the offense. The quarterback touches
                                the ball on almost every offensive play, and his successes and failures can have a significant
                                impact on the fortunes of his team. Accordingly, the quarterback is among the most glorified
                                and scrutinized positions in team sports.<p>

                                <p>Prior to each play, the quarterback tells the rest
                                of his team which play the team will run; after the team is lined up, the center will pass the
                                ball back between his legs to the quarterback (a process called the snap). On a running play,
                                the quarterback will then hand or pitch the ball backwards to a running back.

                                <p>On a passing play,
                                the quarterback will try to throw the ball downfield to a wide receiver, tight end, or running
                                back.[3] Additionally, the quarterback can run with the ball himself. This could be part of
                                a designed play like the option run or quarterback sneak, or it could be an impromptu
                                effort to avoid being sacked by the defense.</p>

                            <h2>Defensive End</h2>

                              <p>  Early formations, with six- and seven-man lines, used the end as a containment player, whose job
                                was first to prevent an "end run" around his position, then secondarily to force plays inside.</p>

                               <p> When most teams adopted a five-man line, two different styles of end play developed: "crashing"
                                ends, who rushed into the backfield to disrupt plays, and "stand-up" or "waiting" ends, who played
                                the more traditional containment style. Some teams would use both styles of end play, depending
                                on game situations.</p>

                              <p>  Traditionally, defensive ends are in a three-point stance, with their free hand cocked back ready
                                to "punch" the offensive lineman, or in a "two-point stance" like a linebacker so they can keep
                                containment. Some defensive ends play the position due to their size; they close down their gap
                                so the running back has no hole to run through. Other ends play the position due to their speed
                                and agility; they are used to rush the quarterback. These ends can time the snap of the ball in
                                order to get a jump on the rush.</p>

                            <h2>Linebacker</h2>

                               <p> A linebacker (LB) is a playing position in American football and Canadian football that was
                                invented by football coach Fielding H. Yost of the University of Michigan,[1] with Germany
                                Schulz being his first linebacker in 1905. Linebackers are members of the defensive team,
                                and line up approximately three to five yards (4 m) behind the line of scrimmage, behind the
                                defensive linemen.</p>

                            <p>Linebackers generally align themselves before the ball is snapped by
                                standing upright in a "two point stance" (as opposed to the defensive linemen, who put one
                                or two hands on the ground for a "three point stance" or "four point stance" before the ball
                                is snapped).</p>

                                <p>The goal of the linebacker is to provide either extra run protection or extra
                                pass protection based on the particular defensive play being executed; Another key play of
                                the linebacker position is blitzing, a Blitz occurs when a linebacker acts as an extra pass
                                rusher running into any exposed gap. When a blitz is called on the defense, it is mainly to
                                sack or hurry the opposing offense's quarterback.</p>

                            <h2>CornerBack</h2>
                            <p>The chief responsibility of the cornerback is to defend against the offense's pass. The rules
                                of American professional football and American college football do not mandate starting
                                position, movement, or coverage zones for any member of the defense.</p>

                              <p>There are no
                                "illegal defense" formations. Cornerbacks can be anywhere on the defensive side of the line
                                of scrimmage at the start of play, although their proximity, formations, and strategies are
                                outlined by the coaching staff or captain.</p>

                                <p>Most modern National Football League defensive formations use four defensive backs (two safeties
                                and two corners); Canadian Football League defenses generally use five defensive backs (one

                                safety, two defensive halfbacks, and two corners).</p>

                                <p>A cornerback's responsibilities vary
                                depending on how the defense assigns protection to its defensive secondary. In terms of defending
                                the run, often corners may be assigned to blitz depending on the coaching decisions in a game.
                                In terms of defending passing plays, a corner will be typically assigned to either zone or
                                man-to-man coverage.</p>

                            <h2>Tight End</h2>
                            <p>The tight end (TE) is a position in American football, Arena football, and formerly Canadian
                                football, on the offense. The tight end is often seen as a hybrid position with the characteristics
                                and roles of both an offensive lineman and a wide receiver. Like offensive linemen, they are
                                usually lined up on the offensive line and are large enough to be effective blockers. On the
                                other hand, they are eligible receivers adept enough to warrant a defense's attention when
                                running pass patterns.</p>

                               <p> Because of the hybrid nature of the position, the tight end's role in any given offense depends
                                on the tactical preferences and philosophy of the head coach. In some systems, the tight end
                                will merely act as a sixth offensive lineman rarely going out for passes. Other systems utilize
                                the tight end primarily as a receiver, frequently taking advantage of the tight end's size to
                                create mismatches in the defensive secondary. Many coaches will often have one tight end who
                                specializes in blocking in running situations while utilizing a better pass catching tight
                                end in obvious passing situations.</p>

                            <p>
                                The defensive line consists of one or two defensive tackles and two defensive ends who play
                                outside the defensive tackles. The defensive line works with the linebackers to try to control
                                the line of scrimmage. </p>

                                <p>The 4-3 defensive formation, most commonly used in the NFL, employs two
                                defensive tackles (and a defensive line of four men, with three linebackers behind them), while
                                the 3-4 formation uses just a single defensive tackle, called the nose tackle (and a defensive
                                line of three men, with four linebackers behind them). However, defensive ends in a typical 3-4
                                have responsibilities more similar to a 4-3 defensive tackle than 4-3 defensive ends.</p>

                                <p>On running plays, the goal is to tackle the ball carrier. The defensive line attempts to
                                maintain their original formation (even spacing without holes), but also to prevent any
                                members of the opposing offensive line from successfully engaging the linebackers, who chase
                                down the ball carrier.</p>
                                <p>The defensive tackles are usually the most skilled run defenders on the team.
                                    y defensive ends--are called upon to do more running than
                                offensive linemen, thus they usually tend to be somewhat lighter and faster.</p>

                            <p>
                               <p> The free safety tends to watch the play unfold and follow the ball. The free safety is
                                typically assigned to the quarterback in man coverage, but as the quarterback usually remains
                                in the pocket the free safety is "free" to double cover another player.

                                <p>On pass plays, the
                                free safety is expected to assist the cornerback on his side and to close the distance to
                                the receiver by the time the ball reaches him. Offenses tend to use the play-action pass
                                specifically to make the free safety expect a run play, which would draw him closer to the
                                line of scrimmage, and reduce his effectiveness as a pass defender.</p>

                                <p>Furthermore, quarterbacks
                                often use a technique to "look off" a free safety, by purposely looking to the other side of
                                the field during a pass play, with the intention to lure the free safety away from the intended
                                target receiver on the other side of the field. This phenomenon often tests how effective a
                                free safety's wit and athleticism are at defending long pass plays. </p>

                                <p>If the offense puts a
                                receiver in the slot, then the free safety may be called upon to cover that receiver. Free
                                safeties occasionally blitz as well. When this happens, the pressure on the quarterback is
                                often very severe since a blitz by a defensive back is not usually anticipated. Because of
                                their speed and deep coverage, free safeties are especially likely to make interceptions.</p>

                            <h2>Wide Receivers</h2>
                            <p>
                                A wide receiver is an offensive position in American and Canadian football, and is the key
                                player in most of the passing plays. Only players in the backfield or the ends on the line
                                are eligible to catch a forward pass. The two players who begin play at the ends of the
                                offensive line are eligible receivers, as are all players in the backfield.M<p/>

                                <p> The backs and
                                ends who are relatively near the sidelines are referred to as "wide" receivers. At the start
                                of play, one wide receiver may begin play in the backfield, at least a yard behind the line
                                of scrimmage, as is shown in the diagram at the right.</p>

                               <p> The wide receiver on the right begins

                                play in the backfield. Such positioning allows another player, usually the tight end, to become
                                the eligible receiver on that side of the line. Such positioning defines the strong side of
                                the field. This is the right side of the field in the diagram shown.</p>

                            <h2>Offensive Line</h2>
                            <p>
                                In American football, the offense is the side which is in possession of the ball. It is their
                                job to advance the ball towards the opponent's end zone to score points. Broadly speaking,
                                the eleven players of the offense are broken into two groups: the five offensive linemen,
                                whose primary job is to block, and the six backs and receivers whose primary job is advance
                                the ball by means of either running with the ball or passing it. </p>

                             <p>   The backs and receivers are
                                also commonly known as skill position players or as eligible ball carriers (offensive linemen
                                are not normally eligible to advance the ball during each play).</p>

                               <p> The organization of the offense is strictly mandated by the rules; there must be at least
                                seven players on the line of scrimmage and no more than four players (known collectively as
                                "backs") behind it on every play.</p>

                                   <p>The only players eligible to handle the ball during a normal
                                play are the backs and the two players on the end of the line (the "ends"). The remaining
                                players (known as "interior linemen") are considered "ineligible", and may only block. Within
                                these strictures, however, creative coaches have developed a wide array of offensive formations
                                to take advantage of different player skills and game situations.</p>

                             <p>   The following positions are standard in nearly every game, though different teams will use
                                different arrangements of them.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Fullback</h2>
                            <p>The full-backs take up the holding wide positions and traditionally stayed in defence at all
                                times, until a set-piece. Modern full-backs take a more attacking role, overlapping with
                                wingers down the flank. There is one full-back on each side of the field except in defences
                                with fewer than four players, where there may be no full-backs and instead only centre-backs.</p>

                            <p>
                                [7] The traditional English full-back was a large, strong man who would make substantial use
                                of "hacking" – deliberately kicking the shins of opponents, a practice that was accepted as
                                legal in Britain but not in other countries, and caused major controversy as the game became
                                increasingly internationalised from the 1950s on.</p>


                                <p>It is now effectively banned everywhere,
                                and it is this in part that has given rise to a different set of defensive roles. The full-backs
                                have become essential in the modern game formation 4-3-3 or the now commonly used 4-2-3-1 formation.</p>

                            <p>
                                A halfback is the holder of an offensive position in American football whose duties involve
                                lining up in the backfield[1] and carrying the ball on most running plays in formations such
                                as the veer variant of the wishbone. </p>

                                <p>When the principal ball carrier lines up deep in the
                                backfield, and especially when that player is placed behind another player (usually a blocking
                                back), as in the I formation, that player is instead referred to as a tailback (see Early
                                offensive backfields below).</p>

                                <p> Historically, from the 1870s through the 1950s, the halfback
                                position was both an offensive and defensive position. In the related sport of Canadian football,
                                halfback is usually a defensive rather than offensive position since the 1980s, however used
                                to also refer to an offensive position similar to a slotback that could line up off the tight
                                end or behind the quarterback.</p>

                               <p>In American football and Canadian football, defensive backs (DBs) are the players on the
                                    defensive team who take positions somewhat back from the line of scrimmage; they are
                                    distinguished from the defensive line players and linebackers, who take positions directly
                                    behind or close to the line of scrimmage.</p>

                             <p>   The defensive backs, in turn, generally are classified into several different specialized positions:

                                Safety:
                                Free Safety - most often the deepest safety
                                Strong Safety - the bigger more physical safety, much like a small, quicker linebacker
                                Defensive halfback (Canadian football only)
                                Cornerback - which include:
                             </p>



                               <p> nickel back - the fifth defensive back in some sets, like the Nickel formation
                                dime back - the sixth defensive back in some sets, like the Dime formation
                                The seventh defensive back, in the exceedingly rare 'quarter' set
                                known as a dollar back or a quarter back (not to be confused with the offensive player who
                                    throws the ball)</p>


                                <p>The group of defensive backs is known collectively as the secondary. They most often defend
                                    the wide receiver corps; however, at times they may also line up against a tight end or
                                    a split out running back. They are usually the smallest, quickest players on the field.

                               </p>
